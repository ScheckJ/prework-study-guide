# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

The goal of the Prework Study Guide was to assist boot camp students like myself by creating a webpage as they went through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The project taught us how to create a webpage in simple but thorough steps, which we will need as a foundational skill as we advance through the course.
